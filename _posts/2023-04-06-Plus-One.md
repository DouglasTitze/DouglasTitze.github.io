# My Thoughts  

**What Went Well**  
Surprisingly, my program was able to rank highly in solution statistics.

**What I Learned**  
I learned multiple unique ways to mutate arrays, strings, and maps.

**Comments**  
I knew this would not be the "optimal" solution, but I wanted to try and find the most Pythonic solution possible.

# Solution Statistics  

**Time Spent Coding**  
10

**Time Complexity**  
O(n) - Although there are six O(n) operations, we ignore multiples of n, resulting in the O(n) time complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(1) - Only one new variable is created and instantly returned, resulting in the O(1) space complexity.

**Runtime Beats**  
88.42% of other submissions  

**Memory Beats**  
93.81% of other sumbissions  

# Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # # Convert each element of digits into a string
        # step1 = map(str,digits) # O(n)
        # # Join elements into a string
        # step2 = "".join(step1) # O(n)
        # # Convert string to an int
        # step3 = int(step2) # O(n)
        # # Add one to the int
        # step4 = step3 + 1 # O(1)
        # # Convert int to string
        # step5 = str(step4) # O(n)
        # # Make each character of the string into an element of an array
        # step6 = [*step5] # O(n)
        # # Convert each element in the array into an integer
        # step7 = map(int,step6) # O(n)
        # # Return the "array" (It actually returns a map object)
        # return step7
        return map(int,[*str(int("".join(map(str,digits))) + 1)])
```
