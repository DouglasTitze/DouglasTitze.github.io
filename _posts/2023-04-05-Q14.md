# Solution Statistics  

**Time Complexity**  
O(n * m) - For each element in jewels (n) we traverse each element in stones (m), resulting in the O(n * m) time complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(1) - Only one new variables are created, and the number of variables declared does not depend on the number of elements in the string, resulting in the O(1) space complexity.

# Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        num_jewels = 0
        
        for jewel in jewels: # O(n)
            num_jewels += stones.count(jewel) # O(m)

        return num_jewels
```

# Code BreakDown
Our variable ```num_jewels``` will hold the number of jewels in the stones array. 

We iterate through each element in the jewels array using  ```for jewel in jewels:```

For each element in jewels, we will search through the stones array using ```stones.count(jewel)```, which will return the total number of occurrences of the current jewel in stones. We will add that returned value to the current number of jewels. ```num_jewels +=``` 

Finally, we return the total number of found jewels. ```return num_jewels```
