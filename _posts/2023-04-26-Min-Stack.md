# My Thoughts  

**What Went Well**  
I knew that this problem required two stacks., one to act as the regular stack and then a min stack to abide by the O(1) operation time for each method.

**How I Can Improve**  
I can take advice from the most optimal solution and learn when to add more conditions to reduce the execution time for non-critical values.

**Comments**  
The solution statistics for my code and the optimal solution varied by over 50%, so as usually take them with a grain of salt.

# Data Structure Description

**Stack -** A stack is similar to an array, except you are only allowed to push/pop (add/remove) from the end of the stack. A stack follows the first in, last out, or FILO theme.

Since Python already has O(1) push (append) and pop (pop) operations, we do not need to use any libraries.

# Solution Statistics  

**Time Spent Coding**  
15 minutes

**Time Complexity**  
O(1) - All the operations are O(1), although there are multiple O(1) instructions. 
Regardless, big O ignores constants, resulting in the O(n) time complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(n) - In reality, we store each input value twice, resulting in O(2 * n), but big O ignores constant multiples of n. 
So, the end result is a space complexity of O(n).

# Solution  

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []

    def push(self, value: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        
        # Assign the smallest value to val out of the 
        # current last element and the input value
        if self.minStack:
            val = min(val,self.minStack[-1])

        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:

        # Since stacks follow the FILO principle, we are unable
        # to remove the minimum from the stack without also removing 
        # all of its occurrences from the minStack, therefore we do not 
        # need to perform extra operations when poping from minStack
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]
```
