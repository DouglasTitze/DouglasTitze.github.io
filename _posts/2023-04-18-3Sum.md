# My Thoughts  

**What I Learned**  
I learned how to apply the two-pointer algorithm in a new way and use it in a more challenging problem.

**How I Can Improve**  
Consistently studying my algorithms and improving my ability to recognize patterns in those problems will help me improve my coding skills.

# Algorithm Description

**Two Pointer Algorithm -** If a list is sorted and we place a pointer at the extreme values (max and min), we can iterate one pointer at a time to approach the solution. 

In this problem, we use the two-pointer algorithm on the elements between our ith + 1 element and the end of the list. So our search interval for the two pointer algorithm is [i+1:len(nums)]

# Solution Statistics  

**Time Complexity**  
O(n<sup>2</sup>) - We are iterating through each element in the list (n) when executing the for loop and then iterating through at worse n-2 elements during each iteration of that for loop, resulting in the O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. 
Since our logic results in a worse time complexity than sorting the list (O(n log n)), we ignore it and go with the larger complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(1) - Python's built-in sorting has an O(1) space complexity, and we are only creating four variables that do not depend on the size of the input list, resulting in the O(1) space complexity.

# Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        trip = []

        # Sorting the list allows us to use the two pointer algorithm on the remaining 
        # elements after selecting the first element
        nums.sort()
        
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):

            # To avoid duplicates and refine our time complexity, we can check these conditions
            # Essentially skipping numbers we have already checked
            if i > 0 and n == nums[i-1]:
                continue


            # Perform two sum with the target being 0
            p0,p1 = i+1, len(nums) - 1

            while p0 < p1:

                # Assign the sum to tot and check its value
                tot = nums[p0] + nums[p1] + n

                if tot > 0:
                    p1 -=1
                
                elif tot < 0:
                    p0 += 1
                
                else:
                    trip.append([n,nums[p0],nums[p1]])
                    p0 +=1

                    # Another method to avoid duplicates and refine our time complexity
                    # Essentially skipping numbers we have already checked and
                    # ensuring we properly increment to the next element
                    while nums[p0] == nums[p0-1] and p0 < p1:
                        p0 += 1

        return trip
