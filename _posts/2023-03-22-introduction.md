### Welcome to My Website

My website is a space for me to track my progress and share my experiences as I work towards becoming an AI developer. One of the main features of my website is my daily coding challenge, where I complete a coding problem every day and share the link, time spent, and code I come up with. By doing so, I hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and assist those who are also on their coding journey.

### My Other Projects

Additionally, I share my other projects on my website, including professional and school projects, as well as interesting class notes. This allows me to showcase my skills and experiences and reflect on what I have learned and accomplished.

### My Repository of Knowledge

My website also serves as a repository of knowledge where I keep track of my coding progress, my projects, and my experience all in one place. This way, I can reinforce what I am learning by creating short blog posts about what I have learned, and have a resource to look back on in the future. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and I firmly believe that with persistence and hard work, I can achieve my goal.

### My Goal

Through sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to take action, even if it's just taking small steps towards their goals. I am creating this website not to boast about how amazing I am at solving problems but to face myself with reality and hold myself accountable. By doing so, I can learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and continuously improve.
