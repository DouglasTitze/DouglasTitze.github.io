### View *Base 7* on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/description/){:target="_blank"}  

## Statistics  

**Time Complexity**  
O(n) - The algorithm traverses each element from the list (n), trumping the log base-7 time complexity of the mathematical conversion, resulting in the O(n) time complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(n) - The algorithm must accurately convert the input number to base 7, taken to have `n` numbers, resulting in the O(n) space complexity.

## Explanation  
Before converting, create a list to contain the converted number, eliminate the base case (num = 0), and store the correct sign of the result.

Begin iteratively dividing the input number by the new base (7) and append its remainder to the converted list.

Once the number is less than or equal to 0, return the combination of the sign and the number (in string representation).  

_Since the converted number is being created by appending to a list, each number appended is in reverse order. To correct this, join the list in reverse ([::-1])._

## Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToBase7(self, num: int) -> str:
        s = []
    
        if num == 0: return "0"
        
        sign = ''
        if num < 0:
            sign = '-'
            num = -num
        
        while num > 0:
            s.append(str(num%7))
            
            num //= 7
    
        return sign + ''.join(s[::-1])
```
