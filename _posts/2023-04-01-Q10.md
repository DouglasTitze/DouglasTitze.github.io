# My Thoughts  

**What Went Well**  
I completed the problem a lot quicker than I anticipated, and remembred binary search trees and how acnestors work.

**What Went Wrong**  
I did not allow my self to optimize my code.

**What I Learned**  
I refreshed my memory on binary search trees and 

**How I Can Improve**  
I must allot time after each question to analyze my code and look for flaws, because looking at my original solution now I can see many ways to reduce it. 
By allowing my self time to refine my code I can familiarize myself with a scienario that I may endup in during a coding interview.

**Comments**  
Although I only briefly glanced at another users submission, it instantally made me think of how to alter mine to achive similar structure. 
So, I cannot accurately say it only took me "2 minutes" to optimize my code.

# Algorithm Description

**Binary Search Tree -** EXPLAIN

**Lowest Common Ancestor -** EXPLAIN

**Depth First Search -** An algorithm for traversing a tree data structure. 
The algorithm begins at the root node and searches until it can not continue any deeper. 
Once at the deepest point, the algorithm works backward until all the nodes have been visited.

# Original Solution  

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
            def find(root,q,p):    
                root_val = root.val
                q_val     = q.val
                p_val     = p.val

                if root == q or root == q:
                    if root.left:
                        if root.left == p or root.left == q:
                            return root
                    if root.right:
                        if root.right == p or root.left == q:
                            return root

                if (root_val > q_val and root_val < p_val) or (root_val < q_val and root_val > p_val):   
                    return root

                if root_val > q_val and root_val > p_val:
                    root = find(root.left,p,q)
                elif root_val < q_val and root_val < p_val:
                    root = find(root.right,p,q)
                
                return root
            
            return find(root,p,q)
```

# Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
            if root.val > q.val and root.val > p.val:
                return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q)
            elif root.val < q.val and root.val < p.val:
                return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q)
            else:
                return root
```
