## Welcome to My Website

This is a space for me to track my progress and share my experiences as I work towards becoming an AI developer. 
One of the main features of my website is my daily coding challenge, where I complete a coding problem daily, share the solution, the time spent creating the solution, and provide a high-level explanation of the answer and the algorithm/data structures used.
By doing so, I hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and assist those who are also on their coding journey.  

## My Other Projects

Additionally, I share my other projects, including professional and school projects, as well as interesting class notes. 
This allows me to showcase my skills and experiences and reflect on my learning and accomplishments.  

## My Repository of Knowledge

My website also serves as a repository of knowledge where I keep track of my coding progress, projects, and experience in one place. 
By creating concise blog posts on what I learn, I reinforce my knowledge and have a reference for future use. 
I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and I firmly believe that I can achieve my goal with persistence and hard work.  

## My Goal

Through sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to take action, even if it's just taking small steps toward their goals. 
I am creating this website not to boast about how amazing I am at solving problems but to face reality and hold myself accountable. 
Doing so allows me to learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and continuously improve.
