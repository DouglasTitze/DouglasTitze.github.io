## Welcome to My Website

This is a space for me to track my progress and share my experiences as I work towards becoming an AI developer. One of the main features of my website is my daily coding challenge, where I complete a coding problem every day and share the link, time spent, and code I come up with. By doing so, I hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and assist those who are also on their coding journey.  

## My Other Projects

Additionally, I share my other projects, including professional and school projects, as well as interesting class notes. This allows me to showcase my skills and experiences and reflect on what I have learned and accomplished.  

## My Repository of Knowledge

My website also serves as a repository of knowledge where I keep track of my coding progress, my projects, and my experience all in one place. By creating concise blog posts on what I learn, I reinforce my knowledge and have a reference for future use. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and I firmly believe that with persistence and hard work, I can achieve my goal.  

## My Goal

Through sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to take action, even if it's just taking small steps towards their goals. I am creating this website not to boast about how amazing I am at solving problems but to face myself with reality and hold myself accountable. By doing so, I can learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and continuously improve.
