## Welcome to My Website

This is a space for me to track my progress as I work towards becoming an AI developer. 
One of the main features of my website is my coding challenge, where I complete a coding problem near-daily, share the solution, the time spent creating the solution, and provide a high-level explanation of the answer and the algorithm/data structures used.
By doing so, I hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and reinforce what I learned while creating solutions.  

## My Goal

Through sharing my solutions, I hope to inspire others to take action, even if it's just taking small steps toward their goals. 
I am creating this website to assist in my ability to explain my thoughts better while coding and to enable me to recognize coding patterns and appropriate data structures more quickly. 
Doing so allows me to learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and continuously improve.  

## Who Is Douglas Titze

I have a post dedicated to that [here](/about-me/).
