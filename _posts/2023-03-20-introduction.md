### My Daily Coding Challenge

One of the main features of my website is my daily coding challenge. Every day, I will complete a coding problem and post the link to the problem, along with how long it took me to solve it and the code I came up with. By tracking my progress and sharing it with others, I can hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and assist those who are also on their coding journey.

### My Other Projects

In addition to my daily coding challenge, I will also share my other projects on my website. This might include anything from professional projects to school projects to class notes I found interesting.

### My Repository of Knowledge

Finally, my website is a repository of knowledge for myself and others. I will keep track of my coding progress, my projects, and my experience all in one place. This way, I can reinforce what I am learning when it comes to coding and have a resource to look back on in the future. I am hoping to be able to look back at this website and be proud of how far I have come.

### My Goal

Through sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to take action, even if it's just taking small steps towards their goals. Although I acknowledge that some may have more experience or knowledge than me, my determination to become an AI developer drives me to work harder. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and I firmly believe that with persistence and hard work, I can achieve my goal.
