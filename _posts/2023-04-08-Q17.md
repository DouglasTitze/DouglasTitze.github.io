# Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Initialize variables
        deq = deque()   # Time complexity to pop from the 0th index is O(1) compared to an array which is O(n)
        rowMax = len(matrix)
        colMax = len(matrix[0])

        # Append matrix elements that are 0 to the deque
        # If not equal to 0 then set matrix value to -1
        for n in range(rowMax):     # O(n)
            for m in range(colMax): # O(m)
                if matrix[n][m] == 0:
                    deq.append((n, m))
                else:
                    matrix[n][m] = -1

        # Loop until the deque is empty
        while deq:
            # Place current x and y into variables
            x, y = deq.popleft()    # O(1)

            # Iterate through each possible direction
            for r, c in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:

                # Add current direction to the current position
                newX, newY = x+r, y+c

                # Check if the new variables are within the matrix
                # &&
                # Check if the new element has not yet been visited (== -1)
                if 0 <= newX < rowMax and 0 <= newY < colMax and matrix[newX][newY] == -1:

                    # Since we begin at each of the 0's in the matrix, all the first elements visited are set 1
                    # We now append every newly visited elements, causing any element visited to now be set to 2
                    # Continue this trend until all elements have been visited
                    matrix[newX][newY] = matrix[x][y] + 1
                    deq.append((newX, newY))

        return matrix
```
