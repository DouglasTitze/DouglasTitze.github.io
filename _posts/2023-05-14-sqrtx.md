## Statistics  

**Time Spent Coding**  
5 minutes

**Time Complexity**  
O(1) - Since we are not iterating through any number of elements, we "technically" have a time complexity of O(1). 

Realistically the time complexity is O($\sqrt{x}$), but this evaluates to a constant, and big O notation recognizes this as O(1) time complexity.

**Space Complexity**  
O(1) - The number of variables created is constant and does not depend on the input, resulting in the O(1) space complexity.

## Explanation
The code follows the standard algorithm to evaluate a square root but changes two things to follow the requirements of the problem correctly.

In the standard algorithm, we must iterate until the root's precision is too large to differentiate from the last iteration. 
Ours implements floor division (`//`) instead of normal division and only iterates until the `root`'s square is less than or equal to x.

Once it is less than or equal to x, we have reached the floored square root of x and can return `root`.

## Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return x

        root = x

        while root * root > x:
            root = (root + x // root) // 2

        return root
```
