# My Thoughts  

**What Went Well**  
I was able to undestand the problem and create a near functional program.

**What Went Wrong**  
I could not figure out trees with two nodes kept giving me a result off by one.

**What I Learned**  
I learned how to find the diameter of a tree and got some practice in with depth first search.

**How I Can Improve**  
Practice more, if I had more experience with trees and algorithms I might have been able to solve the problem. 
I also would have benifit from saving my original solution instead of completely deleteing it, this may have helped me combined my two semi working programs into one that was fully functional.

**Comments**  
I knew the algorithm to follow and how to implement it, but one of my test cases kept incorrectly adding one to my result. 
Unfortunately, even after scrapping my code and starting from scratch, my logic began work only for trees with two nodes.

# Solution  

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.diam = 0

        def dps(root):
            if root == None: return 0

            l = dps(root.left)
            r = dps(root.right)

            self.diam = max(self.diam,l+r)
            
            return max(l,r) + 1

        dps(root)
        return self.diam
```
