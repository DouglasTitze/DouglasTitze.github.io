# My Thoughts  

**What Went Well?**  
I quickly remembered the algorithm and set up the entire solution within 4 minutes.

**What Went Wrong?**  
I spent too much time correcting an almost-complete solution that kept resulting in infinite loops.

**What I Learned?**  
I realize I should have tried reading my code out loud or attempting different solutions when struggling.
I also refreshed my memory on a critical algorithm.

**How I Can Improve**  
To prevent similar issues in the future, I need to recognize edge cases that cause infinite loops more easily.
I can accomplish this by attempting a solution, even if entirely wrong, instead of just staring at my code. 

**Comments**  
This experience shows that every day won't be perfect, and that's okay.
The purpose of my website is not to showcase my flawless problem-solving skills but to hold myself accountable and continuously improve.
By sharing my challenges and reflecting on what went well and what went wrong, I can learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and progress toward my goal.

# Algorithm Description

**Binary Search Algorithm:** A sorting algorithm that repeatedly halves the search interval until the target variable is found at the middle index.  

**Visual Examples:**  
Binary search performed on an array that contains the target, [image](https://ds1-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp/unsorted-arrays/binary-search/images/binary_search_stepwise.png){:target="_blank"}  
Binary search performed on an array that does **not** contain the target, [image](https://storage.googleapis.com/algodailyrandomassets/tutorials-optimized/binarySearch1.png){:target="_blank"}

# Solution Statistics  

**Time Spent Coding**  
17 minutes  
**Time Complexity**  
O(n log n) - Fixed-time complexity due to the algorithm. The algorithm halves each iteration's search interval, resulting in the O(n log n) time complexity. (Fastest possible time complexity for all search algorithms)  
**Space Complexity**  
O(1) - Only three new variables are created. The number of variables declared does not depend on the number of items in the list, resulting in the O(1) space complexity.

# Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # Left index
        l = 0               
        # Right index
        r = len(nums) - 1   

        while r >= l:       
            # Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result
            m = (l+r)//2

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                # +1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                l = m + 1   
            
            else:
                # -1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                r = m - 1   

        return -1
```

# Recursive Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def bin_search(l,r,target):
            if r < l:
                return -1       

            # Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result
            m = (l+r)//2    

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                # +1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                return bin_search(m + 1,r,target)   
            
            else:
                # -1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                return bin_search(l, m - 1,target)   
                
        # Left index
        l = 0        
        # Right index       
        r = len(nums) - 1   

        return bin_search(l,r,target)
```
