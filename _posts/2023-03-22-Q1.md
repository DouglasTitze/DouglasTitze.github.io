### Time Spent
17 minutes

### What Went Well 
I remembered the algorithm and set up the entire solution within 4 minutes.

### What Went Wrong
I kept getting infinite loops and didn't know why. I was spending far too much time correcting a solution that was 99% complete.

### What I Learned
I refreshed my memory on a critical algorithm and realized that I should either read my code out loud or attempt solutions when struggling.

### How I Can Improve
I need to recognize edge cases that cause infinite loops more easily. I can accomplish this by attempting a solution, even if entirely wrong, instead of just staring at my code.  
Even when debugging and printing out the variables, I could not identify what was wrong for much longer than I would have liked.

### Comments
First day and I am off to a rough start, but that okay. I am creating this website not to boast about how amazing I am at solving problems, but to face myself with reality. Unfortunately, today was not a good day, but there is always room for improvement, and that is why I am creating this site.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0               #Left index
        r = len(nums) - 1   #Right index

        while r >= l:       
            m = (l+r)//2    #Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1   #+1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
            
            else:
                r = m - 1   #-1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping

        return -1
```

# Recursive Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def bin_search(l,r,target):
            if r < l:
                return -1       

            m = (l+r)//2    #Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                return bin_search(m + 1,r,target)   #+1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
            
            else:
                return bin_search(l, m - 1,target)   #-1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                

        l = 0               #Left index
        r = len(nums) - 1   #Right index

        return bin_search(l,r,target)
```
