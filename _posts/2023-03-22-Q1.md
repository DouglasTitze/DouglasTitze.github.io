### Time Spent
17 minutes

### What Went Well 
I quickly remembered the algorithm and set up the entire solution within 4 minutes.

### What Went Wrong
I spent too much time correcting an almost-complete solution that kept resulting in infinite loops.

### What I Learned
I realize I should have tried reading my code out loud or attempting different solutions when struggling. I also refreshed my memory on a critical algorithm.

### How I Can Improve
To prevent similar issues in the future, I need to recognize edge cases that cause infinite loops more easily. I can accomplish this by attempting a solution, even if entirely wrong, instead of just staring at my code. 

### Comments
This experience shows that every day won't be perfect, and that's okay. The purpose of my website is not to showcase my flawless problem-solving skills, but to hold myself accountable and continuously improve. By sharing my challenges and reflecting on what went well and what went wrong, I can learn from my mistakes, recognize my strengths, and progress towards my goal.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0               #Left index
        r = len(nums) - 1   #Right index

        while r >= l:       
            m = (l+r)//2    #Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1   #+1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
            
            else:
                r = m - 1   #-1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping

        return -1
```

# Recursive Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def bin_search(l,r,target):
            if r < l:
                return -1       

            m = (l+r)//2    #Middle index = sum both indicies, divide by 2, and floor the result

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m

            if nums[m] < target:
                return bin_search(m + 1,r,target)   #+1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
            
            else:
                return bin_search(l, m - 1,target)   #-1 to avoid checking the same value twice and infinite looping
                

        l = 0               #Left index
        r = len(nums) - 1   #Right index

        return bin_search(l,r,target)
```
