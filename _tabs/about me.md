## Hello And Welcome To My Website!  
My name is Douglas Titze, and I am currently studying computer science at the University of South Florida.
In addition to my studies, I am also working as a 3D print lab technician at the university.  

## My Passion
My interest in computer science was sparked in high school when I attended my first coding boot camp, which, coincidentally, took place at the University of South Florida. Since then, I've been captivated by the field.    
  
However, when I first recognized the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionize our world, my passion truly blossomed.
This was before the explosion of OpenAI and ChatGPT, but now I am pursuing my goals with even greater determination than ever before.

## Feedback
I welcome feedback and insights from **all!**
Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-titze/){:target="_blank"} and have a chat.
I would love to exchange ideas on how to advance in this field together.
Please explore my website and share your thoughts.  

I am excited to receive feedback and learn from others as I grow as an AI developer.
Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope my experiences and progress can inspire you to take action toward your goals.
