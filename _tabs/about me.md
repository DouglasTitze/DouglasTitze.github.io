## Hello!

Hello I am Douglas Titze!  
Here are some quick facts about me:
* Senior computer science major at the University of South Florida (USF)
* 3D print lab technician at USF
* Love to solve intricate problems using programming
* Always hungry to learn more algorithmic knowledge
* Began programming at the age of 14 (7 years ago!)

## My Passion

My interest in computer science was sparked in high school when I attended my first coding boot camp, which, coincidentally, took place at the USF.  
Since then, I've been captivated by the field. Although initially, I wanted to become a game developer, I found more interest in data structures and algorithms and their practical applications to real-world problems. 

## Feedback

I welcome feedback and insights from **all** and would love to exchange ideas on advancing in this field.
